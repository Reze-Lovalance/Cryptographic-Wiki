### Cryptography-Wiki: An Educational Project to Make Cryptography Clear and Accessible for Everyone

This project is dedicated to helping everyday people better understand cryptographyâ€”what it is, how it works, and why it matters in the digital world. We present key concepts in a clear and accessible way, with practical examples and real-world relevance.

While the primary focus is on accessibility for non-technical users, we also welcome contributions from the open-source community. If you have at least an intern or early junior-level understanding of systems or development, you're encouraged to contribute and help improve the content and tools.
